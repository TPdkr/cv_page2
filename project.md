# Project details
Can also be found at website portfolio page of the website with more visuals and intereactivity.
Also, more technical detials like repo structure, setup and tools are described in the [readme.md](./README.md) file.

## GOALS
The clear goals for this project are:

- show my projects
- provide contact information
- describe my education and experience
- have a personal visual language that resonates with me personally


The first 3 I addressed through website contents and strucure, that imitates the standard CV section. However, for visual language I had to dig deeper into my interests and wants.

## WORK PROCESS
1. identify key sections and pages
2. gather references and create a visual langauge
3. build prototypes in Luncay and choose the best ones
4. implement the design in code and launch on GitHub pages


Since I already attempted to create a website for this purpose it served as a base in terms of sections to include and information architecture. But content is largely different.

### Project development approach
I went with incremental as there is a clear 100% mark for this with all data included and more or less clear increments, where each time I work on 1 or 2 pages 
and then move to the next step with the previus largely finished. Each increment is either a section withing a page(main page) or a page of its own.

This project has a small iterative components as time moves on. I sometimes need to better styles or reorganize the contents based on feedback and my opinion. So,
once in a while I end up going back to an already completed section.

## DESIGN LANGUAGE

It is inspired by CLIs and old computers. Thus it embraces simplicity and working with limitations such as a small color pallete and low resolution.

Yet I also tried to keep it modern both visually, feature and architecture wise.

## INFORMATION ARCHITECTURE
It is constructed of the few main pages with their respective subsections. It largely replicates my previous attempt and typical CV structures, with an addition of a share website page, which allows me to quickly share the website.

Projects list also includes work projects if possible to share the details of the project publicly.

```

## TARGET AUDIENCE
I tried to target these 2 main groups. So, I made the pages clear and well structured, while also having the space to explore if more
time is available to the person. Moreover, this made me create a share page that 1.0 did not have. 

### Employers and recruiters at career fairs
1. don't have a lot of time
2. expect clear structure
3. used to CV format
4. I likely don't have their contact to share the page

### Other students
1. more curious about the technical and visual aspects
2. also used to CV formatting
3. have more time
